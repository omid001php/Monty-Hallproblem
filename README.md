# Monty-Hallproblem #
####################
The monty_hall function simulates one round of the Monty Hall problem. It randomly assigns one of the three doors to have the prize, randomly chooses a door for the contestant, and then reveals one of the other two doors with a goat behind it. If the contestant chooses to switch, the function chooses the other unopened door. The function returns True if the contestant wins the car, False otherwise.

The main code runs the monty_hall function 10000 times and counts how many times the contestant wins by switching. It then prints the probability of winning by switching.
